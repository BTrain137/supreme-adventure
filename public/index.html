                Harper Monroe and Andrew Decker met in 2009 during senior year of high school, during an Intro to Photography class. Students were assigned a project that required them to shoot architectural buildings throughout San Francisco. One afternoon, they ran into each other on the street - they were photographing the same building, just from different vantage points! - and decided to shoot together. The afternoon turned to evening and ended with ice cream, where they talked until the shop closed. And the rest, as they say, is history.
